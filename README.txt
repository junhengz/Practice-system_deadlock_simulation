The program is to give the suggestion of abort transaction based on the input transactions

You can change the input file or the path in the main function. For instance, you can change the input to input2.txt by:

inFile.open("input.txt"); 

to 
inFile.open("input2.txt");

And when you run the program, you should see an output file generated in the same directory, and the suggestion is in the output file.
